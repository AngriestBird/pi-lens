/**
 * Event-loop occupancy guard for the per-edit cascade graph rebuild.
 *
 * flake-shape: elapsed-time-assertion — the two pure-synchronous cases (the
 * reverse-dependency patch and the impact-cascade traversal) have no
 * deterministic proxy: the defect shape is a complexity class (O(n^2)), and
 * only measured t(4N)/t(N) separates it from linear work. They assert a
 * dimensionless ratio of two real clock deltas, never an absolute budget.
 *
 * `buildOrUpdateGraph` runs on EVERY write/edit (via `computeCascadeForFile` in
 * the per-edit pipeline). Even on a pure cache hit it must re-derive the
 * workspace source-file list and its size/mtime signature, which walks the
 * project tree and stats every source file; that work must yield to the event
 * loop in chunks instead of holding it for the whole walk.
 *
 * Why this file has no millisecond budget (#4046). The previous version
 * asserted `maxSyncBlock < 300 ms` through an independent sampler. It was red
 * on healthy code and green under the regression it named:
 *   - `computeImpactCascade` is one synchronous call, so max block == wall.
 *     It costs ~85 ms on an idle fast core and 337-440 ms at a 25% CPU share
 *     (cpu pinned, three busy loops), so the runner's CPU share alone decided
 *     the verdict (10 of 82 shard-2 runs exhausted their retries).
 *   - its 1200-file fixture exceeded the 1,000-file review-graph cap, so
 *     `buildOrUpdateGraph` returned `mode: "skipped"` before reaching the
 *     chunked stat loops; the builder yield mutant stayed green.
 *
 * The replacement counts behaviour the host cannot change:
 *   - cold and warm builds: the number of `setImmediate` yields the real
 *     build makes. It is 2 x floor(files / STAT_YIELD_EVERY) (two stat loops
 *     walk every file; measured 18 at 900 files and cadence 100, 36 at 50,
 *     12 at 150, 8 at 200, 0 with the yield off). The floor is derived from
 *     the fixture and the cadence READ FROM THE BUILDER SOURCE, so it
 *     tracks a legitimate cadence change but not a mutation of the built
 *     output. Also zero synchronous `readdirSync` calls on the warm path
 *     (healthy 0, synchronous walk 154), on a fixture under the cap whose
 *     build mode is asserted not `skipped`;
 *   - the pure-sync operations: the MEDIAN of per-pair ratios t(4N)/t(N) over
 *     interleaved pairs against a limit of 7, aborting as soon as the
 *     verdict is decided (measurements are in the PR that introduced this
 *     header).
 *
 * NB: tests run against the COMPILED .js (npm run build emits in-place and
 * vitest resolves the `.js` specifier to it), so a source change only takes
 * effect after a rebuild; CI builds before `npm test`.
