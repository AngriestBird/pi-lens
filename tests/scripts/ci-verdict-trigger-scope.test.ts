/**
 * #4090: ci-verdict gated on every check-run attached to a commit, including
 * the ones a schedule or a workflow_dispatch run attached to it. Seen
 * 2026-10-07: the daily `untriaged-issues.yml` run left `Detect untriaged
 * issues` (failure) on master's head eb25d80cb (`ci-verdict` exit 1, MASTER-RED
 * fired), and #4076's required dispatch of `stryker-nightly.yml` left
 * `Stryker shard 0 (12 files)` (failure) on the PR head (`ci-verdict 4076` exit
 * 1). Both are real shapes captured from the live API: a check-run carries
 * `check_suite.id`, `app.slug` and `head_sha`; the workflow run for the head
 * carries the same `check_suite_id` and the `event` that triggered it.
 *
 * Red-first: every `run()` case below is red on master's `ci-verdict.mjs`
 * except the ones that pin the fail-safe direction (they pin today's gating,
 * which the fix must keep).
