/**
 * Tests for scripts/with-test-lock.mjs's pure helpers (#1101, PR #1112 review
 * round 2):
 *
 *  - `resolveVitestEntry` — the primary, shell-free dispatch path: resolves
 *    vitest's own package.json `bin` field so it can be launched via
 *    `node <entry> <args>` directly, with `shell: false`, on every OS. This
 *    is the path every real caller (npm test / test:unit / test:integration,
 *    all of which wrap `vitest run [...]`) actually takes.
 *
 *  - `quoteForWindowsCmd` — the FALLBACK-ONLY path used when the wrapped
 *    command isn't `vitest` (no such caller exists today). Pinned here as
 *    documentation of its real, known limits per the PR #1112 review: it
 *    defends against Windows's "shell:true + args array doesn't quote"
 *    space/quote-splitting bug, but it is NOT a shell-injection-safe
 *    escaper — a quote-containing argument can flip cmd.exe's quote parity,
 *    and `%VAR%` expansion is untouched by quoting. These tests assert the
 *    exact (imperfect) output rather than spawning a real cmd.exe, so they
 *    stay OS-agnostic and fast; the comments describe what a real cmd.exe
 *    would do with that output.
