/**
 * #3968 class sweep — "a lane claims a dialect or capability it cannot serve,
 * with no ownership channel".
 *
 * Population census over the dispatch runners (`clients/dispatch/runners/**`,
 * `.ts` sources only, never the compiled twins), two detector families:
 *
 *   A. **literal-id self-skip predicates** — a CLI runner calling
 *      `lspPrimaryCoversFile(ctx, "<id>")` with an id that is not the
 *      runner's OWN id. The seam's arg is the RUNNER CAPABILITY being
 *      subsumed; asking for another lane's server id was #3968's defect
 *      (the shellcheck runner could never be deferred by a covering shell
 *      LSP that wasn't literally named `bash`).
 *
 *   B. **hardcoded dialect/tool-flag argv** — a runner that emits a dialect
 *      selector flag (`--shell`) without routing the value through the
 *      pinned resolver (`resolveShellFileDialect` in shellcheck.ts). The
 *      pre-fix runner hardcoded `--shell bash` on every file — the SC1071 /
 *      bash-semantics defect itself — so the census holds the flag to the
 *      resolver; a new runner gaining a dialect selector reds until it
 *      resolves dialects too.
 *
 *   C. **builtin covers-fact consultation by id collision** (F2) — the
 *      runner-coverage seam must resolve a claim's provenance from the ROW
 *      (`primary.custom`), never consult `BUILTIN_SERVER_RUNNER_COVERS` for
 *      a custom primary: a `lsp.servers.<id>` overlay collides with the
 *      builtin id, and an id-keyed fact lookup inherits a claim the declared
 *      server never made (the lane the user registered silently suppresses
 *      the CLI runner). The census pins ONE consultation site in the tree,
 *      guarded on row provenance; a second consult site reds the floor.
 *
 * Sources are comment-and-string-blanked (`stripSource`) so prose or a
 * string literal can never satisfy a requirement, and the floors are real
 * populations (an empty census fails loud, defect shape 10).
