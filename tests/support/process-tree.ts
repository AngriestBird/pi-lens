 * SIGKILL a spawned child AND everything below it (#4081).
 *
 * `child.kill("SIGKILL")` reaches only the direct child. The real pi leaves
 * grandchildren behind (knip, `npx ast-grep scan`, typescript-language-server
 * --version), and they are not even in its process group: pi's launcher
 * spawns them detached, so each is the leader of its own group. They are
 * reparented and keep writing under the scratch HOME for up to ~1.5 s, which
 * is what turned a recursive teardown into ENOTEMPTY. A group kill of the
 * child's group would not reach them, so the tree is walked by parent pid.
 *
 * Returns the pids signalled (the child first), for a caller that must wait
 * until they are gone. An already-reaped child returns [] and signals nothing:
 * its pid may have been recycled, and its children are no longer discoverable.
 *
 * POSIX: freeze (SIGSTOP) the child and every descendant `ps` lists, re-walk
 * until no new descendant appears (at most {@link MAX_WALKS} walks), then
 * SIGKILL every frozen pid.
 * Windows: `taskkill /T /F`, the same tree kill the production seam uses.
