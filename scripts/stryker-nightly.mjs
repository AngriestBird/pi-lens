/**
 * Nightly Stryker test-adequacy report: the state and body halves (#4005).
 *
 * `.github/workflows/stryker-nightly.yml` runs `scripts/stryker-diff.mjs` over
 * `<last-report-sha>..HEAD` on master and files ONE rolling tracking issue
 * through `scripts/upsert-tracking-issue.mjs`. This script owns the two steps
 * around the driver:
 *
 *   node scripts/stryker-nightly.mjs base --issues FILE --title TITLE
 *     [--pending-out FILE]
 *     Prints GITHUB_OUTPUT lines `base=<sha>`, `source=<issue|fallback-no-issue|
 *     fallback-bad-sha>` and `pending=<count>`. The last-report sha is the
 *     marker the previous report left in the tracking issue's body (`gh issue
 *     list --json title,body` output in FILE); no readable marker, or one that
 *     is not an ancestor of HEAD, falls back to the first commit older than 24
 *     hours. The carry-over queue (below) is written to --pending-out, one
 *     `path@sha` (or bare `path`) per line.
 *
 *   node scripts/stryker-nightly.mjs body --issues FILE --title TITLE
 *     --base SHA --head SHA --source S --status ok|failed --out FILE
 *     [--report JSON] [--outcomes JSON] [--run-url URL]
 *     Writes the issue body. After a COMPLETED run (status ok and a report) the
 *     marker advances to HEAD; a FAILED run leaves the marker and the queue as
 *     they were, so tomorrow's window covers it again.
 *
 *   node scripts/stryker-nightly.mjs combine --shards-dir DIR
 *     --expected-shards 0,1 --window W --out JSON --outcomes JSON
 *     Applies the completeness rule (`combineShards`) to the shard artifacts
 *     under DIR: `--out` gets every shard's report in shard order, or null on a
 *     failed night; `--outcomes` gets the status and per-shard verdicts.
 *
 * Carry-over queue: files a run skipped over the --max-files cap, or took but
 * could not finish (ranges sampled away, a budget-ended run), go on a FIFO
 * queue in the body (`<!-- stryker-nightly:pending=a@sha,b@sha -->`, at most
 * 200; the oldest are dropped and the body says so). The next night mutates the
 * queue first, then the new window by weight, under the same cap, and a queued
 * file that was fully evaluated leaves it.
 *
 * The base rule (#4005 r4, derived from the state-space table on PR #4013):
 * each entry carries its own base, the window base of the night that first
 * left the file unevaluated, kept across re-queues. On read, a base that is not
 * an ancestor of HEAD is dropped (the file stays, read against the window
 * base), and a base older than MAX_BASE_AGE_DAYS is re-based onto the floor
 * commit; the body counts both. No queued file is diffed against an unbounded
 * history. Entries are validated on read (`parseQueueEntry`): an edited issue
 * cannot inject a path outside the runtime tree or a base that is not a sha.
 *
 * Why the issue body and not an artifact or a committed file: it needs no
 * permission beyond the `issues: write` the upsert already holds (an artifact
 * read needs `actions: read`, a committed file needs `contents: write` against
 * a protected master), it is durable (artifacts expire), and a maintainer can
 * reset the window by editing the marker.
