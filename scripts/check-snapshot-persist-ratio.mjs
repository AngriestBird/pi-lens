/**
 * Nightly verdict on the project-snapshot persist bench (#3916, recurrence of
 * #3789): did the worker persist's RSS jump drift back toward the cloned shape?
 *
 *   node scripts/bench-snapshot-persist.mjs --persists 1 --out <report-N.json>   (x5)
 *   node scripts/check-snapshot-persist-ratio.mjs --report <report-1.json> ... \
 *     --report <report-5.json> [--body <issue.md>] [--state <file>] [--run-url <url>]
 *
 * One sample is the first persist's RSS jump in worker mode divided by the
 * same persist in sync mode, both from ONE bench invocation on ONE runner, so
 * the runner's allocator and heap limits mostly cancel. The verdict compares
 * the MEDIAN of SAMPLE_COUNT samples with the threshold: the one hosted sample
 * taken first (1.822) sat at the dev box's healthy ceiling (1.831), and a
 * single noisy persist must not flip a nightly either way. Samples are
 * independent bench invocations (each spawns a fresh child process, so a fresh
 * worker and heap, per mode), never later persists of one child.
 *
 * Persist 0 is the sample, not a steady-state max or median: after the first
 * persist the settled-RSS baseline moves with GC timing. The cloning worker's
 * steady runs fell from about 285 MB to about 155 MB mid-run (a median can
 * land on either side), and the fixed worker spiked once to 146-149 MB in 2 of
 * 8 healthy runs (a max can land on the wrong side). Persist 0 separated the
 * trees in every measured local run: 1.688-1.831 on the fixed tree (11 runs),
 * 2.099-2.369 on the cloning tree (9 runs); see
 * tests/fixtures/snapshot-persist-nightly-calibration.json and
 * tests/fixtures/snapshot-persist-measurement.json, pinned by
 * tests/scripts/check-snapshot-persist-ratio.test.ts. Known limit: the
 * control is the same tree's own sync path, which the cloning tree also made
 * heavier (about 150-166 MB against 92-101 MB), so the ratio understates the
 * worker's own regression; that is why the gap is only 1.83 to 2.10.
 *
 * Exit 0 clean, 1 drift (the median exceeds the threshold), 2 a report is
 * unusable or fewer than SAMPLE_COUNT were given (never a drift verdict, but
 * the workflow files the tracking issue with the reason). `--state` receives
 * `clean`, `drift` or `error`; `--body` is written for drift and error and
 * removed on clean.
